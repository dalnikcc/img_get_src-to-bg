# img_get_src-to-bg

The story.

I created slick slider with 9 items. There are arrows and dots. Each dot had been with unique image and in hover image changed. But customer wanted to change images in dots. But slick slider initialized after page was download so I coudn't do this.

I decided to create invisible block with images which customer downloaded from CMS. After that I wrote a script where I create new Image and append this image to slick dots.
